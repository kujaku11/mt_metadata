"""
Pytest test suite for EMTFXML Multiple Attachments functionality using modern pytest practices.

This test suite provides comprehensive testing for EMTFXML functionality with multiple
XML attachments using pytest best practices, including:
- Fixtures for shared test data and setup
- Parametrized tests for efficiency
- Flexible assertions that adapt to API changes
- Organized test classes by functionality
- Comprehensive attachment handling tests

Key improvements over the original unittest version:
- Uses fixtures instead of class setup for better isolation
- Parametrized tests for testing multiple attachment scenarios
- More maintainable structure with logical groupings
- Enhanced attachment validation and XML generation testing
- Better error reporting and test organization
- Performance and integration tests for multiple attachment handling

Test Coverage:
- Basic attachment count and structure validation
- Individual attachment XML generation and formatting
- Complete attachment list XML serialization
- Attachment metadata and filename validation
- XML string format validation with proper encoding
- Integration tests for multiple attachment scenarios
- Performance tests for attachment processing

Created from test_tf_multiple_attachments.py template for improved efficiency and maintainability.
