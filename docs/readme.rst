-------------
The goal of **MT Metadata** is to develop a standard format and tools for archiving 
magnetotelluric (MT) time series and transfer function data.

Metadata standards for MT have been historically relaxed to user dependent.  The goal of this module is to formalize and provide tools for users of MT timeseries and metadata.  

The metadata for time series follows the standards proposed by the `IRIS-PASSCAL MT

The metadata for transfer functions follows those proposed by Anna Kelbert `EMTF XML: New data interchange format and conversion tools for electromagnetic transfer functions <http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1190%2Fgeo2018-0679.1>`__.
